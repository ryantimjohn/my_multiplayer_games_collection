Website Specifications: Game Menu App
Project Goal: Create a mobile-first, responsive web application that serves as a searchable "menu" for a video game collection. The app uses a Google Sheet as the backend database.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or simple framework like React/Vue).

Backend/Data: Google Sheets API (to fetch data).

1. Data Integration (Backend)
Source: Google Spreadsheet Columns Mapping: The application must parse the provided CSV/JSON data from the sheet.

Core Data:

Game Title (String) -> Display Name

Description (String) -> Display Text

Max Players (Number) -> Used for filtering

Systems (Boolean Columns):

Columns: PC, Switch, Wii U, Wii, GameCube, N64, SNES, PS3, PS2, PS1, Xbox 360, Xbox (Original), Dreamcast, Saturn, Genesis, Arcade.

Logic: If the cell is non-empty (or TRUE), the game is available on this system.

Genres (Boolean Columns):

Columns: Shooter, Fighting, Beat 'em Up, Racing, Sports, Party, Puzzle, Platformer, RPG, Adventure.

Logic: If the cell is non-empty (or TRUE), the game belongs to this genre.

2. User Interface (Frontend)
Layout:

Mobile-First Design: The interface must be clean and scrollable, optimized for phone screens.

Sticky Header (Optional): Keep the search/filter options accessible at the top, or use a collapsible "Filter" menu to save screen space on mobile.

Components:

Search Bar (Top):

Input field placeholder: "Search game name..."

Behavior: Real-time filtering of the displayed list based on the Game Title.

Systems Filter:

Label: "Systems"

UI: A flexible grid of checkboxes or toggle chips for each System column listed above.

Behavior (OR Logic):

If no system is selected: Show games from all systems.

If one or more systems are selected: Show games that match at least one of the selected systems.

Genre Filter:

Label: "Genres"

UI: A flexible grid of checkboxes or toggle chips for each Genre column.

Behavior (OR Logic):

Same logic as Systems (Show games matching any selected genre).

Player Count Filter:

Label: "Min Players" (or "Group Size")

UI: Number input box (e.g., type "4").

Behavior:

User inputs the size of their group (e.g., 4).

App filters to show games where Max Players >= Input Value.

Note: Ensure games with empty max player data are handled gracefully (optionally hidden or shown at bottom).

Results List (The Menu):

Display a scrollable list of cards or rows below the filters.

Card Content:

Title: Bold, large text.

Description: Smaller text below the title.

Optional: Badges showing the System/Genre/Max Players for that specific row.

3. Filtering Logic Summary
A game should be displayed ONLY IF it meets ALL active filter groups:

(Search Query matches Title) AND

(Game supports ANY selected System OR no systems selected) AND

(Game matches ANY selected Genre OR no genres selected) AND

(Max Players >= User Input Min Players)

4. Technical Implementation Notes for Replit
Use papaparse or a similar library if fetching the sheet as a CSV publication for a simpler, no-auth backend solution.

Ensure the Max Players column is parsed as an integer for comparison.

CSS Grid/Flexbox should be used for the checkbox lists so they wrap nicely on small phone screens.
